# kaggle-goodreads-competition
Partial project to Kaggle Goodreads Competition. It is still incomplete, as my goal is to get a minimum of 60% of accuracy. 

## Project Overview
This is a Jupyter Notebook that try to predict the rating gave by users in books reviews. You have to determine an ordinal rating from 1 to 5, based on some variables – mainly the user’s reviews. 

The project is part of a Kaggle Competition.

## Details about dataset
The training dataset contains 900k rows and 11 columns, and provides some data like user_id, book_id, rating of the book (1 to 5), a review about the book, number of comments about the review, the number of votes on the review and others. You can check more information about the dataset by clicking <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/goodreads-books-reviews-290312/overview> here </a>.

## Partial results
For the submission of this version of the project, I got a accuracy of 35.5%. My best score until now was 35.9%, and my goal is to reach at least 60% of accuracy.

## What was my motivation?
That was my second personal project in Data Analysis. I found it very challenging if I compare to my <a href=https://github.com/raphaelzaneti/titanic-ml> first project </a>, as now I had to handle with a relevantly bigger training dataset (900k rows vs. 750 rows). 
This project helps me to improve my abilities in Data Analysis, and I intend, while I don’t get a 60% accuracy result, to dedicate some time in explore some data visualizations tools in this project, as this is an ability that I have to improve.

## Why did I build this project?
To improve my Data Analysis skills

## What problem does it solve?
The model can read several rows of data and classify it according to the probable rating of the book. So it is very useful to understand the users perception on the books and, with this, predict if an specific book may have a good or bad rating from the readers. 

## What did I learn?
I had the opportunity to have a first experience with NLP. I already tried to do some document classification with JavaScript in another project, but never with a huge dataset like this. The use of Bag of Words helped me to understand the engine of the basics NLPs algorithms. 

## Future plans
In a first moment, I intend to work with data visualization tools to improve this ability. I also will dedicate some time to other datasets to improve my Data Analytics skills and, after, try to reach a 60% accuracy score in this project.
